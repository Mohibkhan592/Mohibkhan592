#  About Me:
👋 I'm Mohib — I build AI stuff that actually works when real people use it<br><br>Right now I'm at H2O Labs working with US companies to take their AI ideas from "wouldn't it be cool if..." to production systems their teams rely on every day.<br><br>Here's the thing: lots of people can train models. What I care about is building AI that doesn't fall apart the moment it leaves your laptop.<br><br>Stuff I've built that people actually use:<br>- RAG chatbots processing thousands of real user questions daily<br>- AI agents that automated away 60% of repetitive work for entire teams<br>- LLMs fine-tuned and deployed on Azure that scale up when traffic spikes<br>- Coding agents that write actual production code (not the "works on my machine" kind)<br><br>What I work with day-to-day:<br>Python, LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI, HuggingFace, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, FastAPI, Vector databases, all the MLOps tools that keep things running smoothly<br><br>What makes me different:<br>I've trained models for Google's Gemini project, so I've seen what world-class AI development looks like. But I've also spent nights debugging why a model works perfectly in testing and breaks in production.<br><br>I own projects from start to finish — talking to stakeholders who don't know what a token is, designing the system, building it, deploying it, and actually measuring if it's working. I obsess over the boring stuff like latency and costs because that's what makes or breaks real products.<br><br>Also, I teach Generative AI at my university. Turns out if you can explain transformers to undergrads who just want to pass the exam, you can explain your architecture to anyone.<br><br>What I'm geeking out on lately:<br>Building AI agents that can handle complex tasks without hand-holding, integrating voice AI and figuring out how to make powerful AI systems that don't randomly go off the rails.<br><br>I'm looking for projects where the problems are hard, the stakes are real, and the team gives a damn about building things that matter.<br><br>Want to talk shop? mohib6811@gmail.com
